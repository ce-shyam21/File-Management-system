Using Visual Studio
This method is ideal if you're using Visual Studio, which provides a complete IDE with tools for development, debugging, and deployment.

Step 1: Open Your Project in Visual Studio
Launch Visual Studio.
Open your existing project by selecting File > Open > Project/Solution and navigating to your project folder.
If you havenâ€™t created a project yet, you can create a new one by selecting File > New > Project and choosing the appropriate project type (e.g., Console App).

Step 2: Build the Project
Build your project by clicking on Build > Build Solution in the top menu or pressing Ctrl + Shift + B.
This compiles your code and checks for any errors.

Step 3: Run the Program
Run your program by pressing F5 (to run with debugging) or Ctrl + F5 (to run without debugging).
The output will appear in the console window that pops up.
